<p>If you are a designer who happens to know JavaScript, you may be happy to know that Fireworks has a JavaScript API. This tip came from Justin Lee, from <a href="http://www.herxun.co/works/">Herxun</a> who used it to create hotspots on an image of the Taipei Metro map and then used the vectors to embedded clickable regions within a mobile app. The result was impressive. You could touch areas of the map and view contextual info, like estimated wait times, etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I was impressed by how Justin approached the problem of data transformation, considering how painful it can be mobilize vectors of dynamic data. He used Adobe Fireworks, a graphics app. Fireworks has a JavaScript API the he used to perform data processing. When you clicked a region on the image map, contextual information could be displayed. It was an elegant approach that saved lots of time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here is how he did it (per his email to me):</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because Taipei Flora Expo closed a few days ago, the official taipei metro route map changes a lot. With the fireworks work flow, It only take me less than half hour to fix it.
Obtain the Fireworks Console: <a href="http://johndunning.com/fireworks/about/FWConsole" class="bare">http://johndunning.com/fireworks/about/FWConsole</a>
Then draw hotspots on the canvas and select all of them.
After that, open the Fireworks Console, paste below code to in it:</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript">var hotspots = [];
for(var i=0;i {
var hotspot={};
hotspot.id = sel[i].altText;
hotspot.l = sel[i].pixelRect.left;
hotspot.t = sel[i].pixelRect.top;
hotspot.r = sel[i].pixelRect.right;
hotspot.b = sel[i].pixelRect.bottom;
hotspots.push(hotspot);
}

console.log("nhotspots = ");
console.log(hotspots);</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then click ‘Eval’ Button, you will get all coordinates of the hotspots in JSON format.
I hope this may help you sometime.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I haven’t tested this yet, but you I can foresee several use cases.  I may write an app that demonstrates this further.  In the mean time, you can download the map here and try it yourself. Pretty slick.</p>

<p>Ok. I’ve been working on my personal site for about 3 weeks now. Developed the framework (and prototype) for a front-end CMS loader using nifty AJAX.  Then, I ran into a snag…</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>it is not compatible with IE. Well, it’s compatible, but not visually. It’s a stylesheet issue (thankfully) so it will take a bit to fix the bug.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I’ve decided to create my blog and default IE users to it for now. So if you want to view the site with Firefox, you’ll get a peek at what I call FastCMS. BTW: it’s reeeally fast and simple. I’ll be posting some features about it soon, along with screenshots for those that don’t have Firefox.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>UPDATE: I’ve decided not publish the “FastCMS” prototype on my personal site. Sorry. It will be unveiled as part of Domain Labs. All users will default to the blog from the main page.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That’s about it for now. Welcome to my site!</p>
